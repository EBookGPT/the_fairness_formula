You're right, the story needs more "show, don't tell" and impactful dialogue. Here's a critique, focusing on those aspects and pushing for a more narrative-driven approach.

**Overall Critique**

The story feels very expositional. We're being *told* about Jaz's feelings and her plan, but not *shown* them in action. There's a lack of emotional depth and tension. The dialogue is also quite clunky and doesn't feel natural.

**Chapter 1:**

* **Too Much Telling:** We hear about Jaz's emotions, but we don't see them expressed through her actions or reactions.  Instead of saying "The betrayal cut deep," show us how she reacts to the discovery. Does she cry? Scream? Slam doors?
* **Missing Details:**  The initial discovery of Bo's infidelity is vague. What did Jaz find? A text message? A receipt? The discovery should be more visceral and concrete.
* **Lack of Dialogue:**  We don't get a sense of the dynamic between Jaz and Bo. How does he react when she confronts him? What is their conversation like? Dialogue is crucial for character development and tension.

**Chapter 2:**

* **Over-Explaining:** The strategy feels too mechanical.  Instead of outlining every step, show us Jaz *doing* these things.  We need to see her at the gym, working out, flirting, and creating distance.
* **No Conflict:** The gym scenes lack conflict.  How does Bo react to her changes?  Is he suspicious?  Angry?  This is where the tension should build.

**Chapter 3:**

* **Too Many "Telling" Sentences:** "She started by planting seeds of doubt" -  Show us how she plants those seeds.  What does she say? How does Bo react?
* **Artificial Dialogue:**  The dialogue feels too contrived.  "Who was that, Bo?" -  This line is too obvious.  Jaz should use subtler, more nuanced language to create doubt.

**Chapter 4 (Missing):**

* **The Fairness Formula:**  Explain this concept in more detail. What exactly is the formula? What are the rules? 
* **Bo's Reaction:**  How does he respond to Jaz's manipulation?  Does he break down? Become angry?  This is where the emotional core of the story should be.
* **Turning Point:**  What specific action or event causes Bo to confront Jaz? What is the nature of his confrontation?

**Chapter 5 (Missing):**

* **Bo's Revelation:**  How does Bo react to Jaz's confession?  Is he shocked?  Relieved?  Angry?
* **The Final Test:** What is this test? What does it reveal about Bo? How does it contribute to the resolution of the story?
* **Resolution:**  How does their marriage change?  What is the final state of their relationship?

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of describing Jaz's emotions, show us how she acts and reacts.  Use vivid details, sensory language, and body language to convey her feelings.
* **Develop Dialogue:**  Create dialogue that feels natural and reveals character.  Use subtext, tension, and conflict to make the interactions more compelling.
* **Deepen the Conflict:**  Explore the inner turmoil of both Jaz and Bo. What are their motivations?  What are their fears?  What are the consequences of their actions?
* **Embrace Narrative Structure:**  Use scene breaks, flashbacks, and shifting perspectives to create a more dynamic and engaging story.

**Example of Showing Instead of Telling:**

**Instead of:** "The betrayal cut deep, a sharp blade slicing through the tapestry of their marriage."

**Try:**  Jaz stared at the phone, her fingers still trembling from the call. The screen flickered, displaying the same photo of Bo and her that she'd set as their wallpaper eight years ago. Now, it felt like a lie, a cruel mockery of their shared dreams.  A sob escaped her lips, hot and bitter. She slammed the phone down on the table, the sound echoing through the empty kitchen. 

By showing Jaz's physical reaction and using sensory details, the reader can feel her pain more intensely.

Remember, a good thriller keeps the reader on the edge of their seat. Use suspense, twists, and strong character development to create a story that is both compelling and emotionally resonant.
